# Textarea with Real-Time Character Counter

## Project Overview
This project is a simple and interactive text area where users can type messages with a **real-time character counter**. The counter displays the number of characters typed and the remaining characters allowed. The project also includes a **neon blue glow effect** on the container when the textarea is focused and is fully responsive for all devices.

## How It Works

1. The user types in the textarea.
2. JavaScript tracks the input event and updates the counter in real-time.
3. If the user reaches the maximum character limit:
   - The input is truncated to the limit.
   - A warning message is displayed.
4. The container glows with neon blue to indicate focus.
5. The layout adapts to different screen sizes, maintaining readability and spacing.
